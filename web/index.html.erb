        <h2>Html<span>&#x2770;&#x2771;</span></h2>
        <p>
          Html is the beautiful substrate of the web.  Finding more
          semantically correct ways to express content is a
          constantly evolving task.  I'm definitely on board with the
          changes brought about by html5 and I think they will make
          the web a better place.  Html audio is great and <em>of
          course</em> I have a strong opinion about html video
          codecs!
        </p>
        <div class='left html5-bg'>

        </div>
        <p>
          On the other hand, a nice big helping of pragmatism can go
          a very long way.  Sometimes things should just be as simple
          as they possibly can and that means regular old
          technologies and techniques.  I'm ok with that and I
          actually think its pretty great sometimes.

        <h2>Css<span>&#x273b;</span></h2>
        <p>
          Other than javascript, Writing cross browser style sheets
          is probably where I have the most experience.  I've dealt
          with peekaboo bugs, IE hacks, floats, and redesigned *ahem*
          table layouts as semantic documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm of the opinion that anything worth doing is worth doing
          using progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.
          You shouldn't leave legacy users in the cold (however much
          you want to) and more able clients should be given the most
          advanced experience possible.

        <h2>Javascript<span>&#x2774;&#x2775;</span></h2>
        <p>
          I <span class='heart'><3</span> javascript.
          <code>(function(){})()</code> is a lexical scoping hug, and
          <code>{}</code> is an object literal kiss.
        </p>
        <div class='right javascript-bg'>
          <img class='fadein' src='<%= BD::Hash['/img/javascript-small.jpg'] %>'>
        </div>
        <p>
          I know all the ins and outs of variable hoisting and the
          implications of having function scope as opposed to block
          scope.  Using <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code>
          comes naturally and prototypal inheritence is way cooler
          than the classical style.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hopelessly obsessed with <a target='_blank'
          href='http://nodejs.org'>node.js</a> and javascript has
          become my everyday scripting language of choice.

        <h3>Environment _</h3>
        <p>
          I'm all about the command line.  I don't like to take my
          hands off the keyboard if I don't have to and for my money
          linux has the best tools for such an environment.  I've
          used a number of different distros, but I don't have a hard
          preference as long as my favorite unix tools are handy
          (grep, sed, awk, etc).
        </p>
        <div class='right nodejs-bg'>
          <img class='fadein' src='<%= BD::Hash['/img/nodejs-small.jpg'] %>'>
        </div>
        <p>
          As stated above, I have become infatuated with <a
          target='_blank' href='http://nodejs.org'>node.js</a>.  If
          you have a project that needs to be written with node,
          please let me know as soon as possible.  Seriously, I might
          do it for free.  Ok, ok, I don't work for free.  (But
          really, I might pay
          you to work on it.)

        <h3>Source Control &#x00b1;&#x00b1;&#x00b1;</h3>
        <p>
          Source control is absolutely fundamental to any software
          project and using it correctly makes things go much more
          smoothly.  Git is definitely what I'm most comfortable
          with.  It's fast, simple and rock-solid.
          <code>stash</code>, <code>rebase</code>, and
          <code>log</code> save me huge amounts of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have fairly extensive experience with subversion.
          DVCS is the future of source control but in the meantime
          svn is still the industry standard so I can merge tree
          conflicts without breaking a sweat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides git and subversion, I have a working knowledge of
          mercurial and bazaar.  Nothing fancy mind you, but given
          the need I could find my way around.

            I'm currently hacking to create a community and social
            network for conferences and events through coffeescript.
            Besides writing lots of coffeescript I'm also enjoying the
            opportunity to dig into ruby and rails, something I've
            wanted to do for a long while.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's by far the best environment for writing code I've ever
            worked in.  The people I work with are very talented and it
            barely feels like work.

            MVC paradigm.  I also helped out other developers who
            didn't have much experience writing javascript.

            Since I was the only developer, I learned a great deal
            about cleaning up my own messes and just making things work.
