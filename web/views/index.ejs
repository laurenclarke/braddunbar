				<h2>Html&#x2770;&#x2771;</h2>
				<p>
					Html is the beautiful substrate of the web.  Finding more
					semantically correct ways to express content is a
					constantly evolving task.  I'm definitely on board with the
					changes brought about by html5 and I think they will make
					the web a better place.  Html audio is great and <em>of
					course</em> I have a strong opinion about html video
					codecs!
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, a nice big helping of pragmatism can go
					a very long way.  Sometimes things should just be as simple
					as they possibly can and that means regular old
					technologies and techniques.  I'm ok with that and I
					actually think its pretty great sometimes.

				<h2>Css&#x273b;</h2>
				<p>
					Other than javascript, Writing cross browser style sheets
					is probably where I have the most experience.  I've dealt
					with peekaboo bugs, IE hacks, floats, and redesigned *ahem*
					table layouts as semantic documents.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm of the opinion that anything worth doing is worth doing
					using progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.
					You shouldn't leave legacy users in the cold (however much
					you want to) and more able clients should be given the most
					advanced experience possible.

				<h2>Javascript&#x2774;&#x2775;</h2>
				<p>
					I <span class='heart'><3</span> javascript.
					<code>(function(){})()</code> is a lexical scoping hug, and
					<code>{}</code> is an object literal kiss.
				</p>
				<p>
					I know all the ins and outs of variable hoisting and the
					implications of having function scope as opposed to block
					scope.  Using <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code>
					comes naturally and prototypal inheritence is way cooler
					than the classical style.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm hopelessly obsessed with <a target='_blank'
					href='http://nodejs.org'>node.js</a> and javascript has
					become my everyday scripting language of choice.

			<h2>Tools</h2>
			<article class='prepend-1 span-7 append-1'>
				<h3>Environment _</h3>
				<p>
					I'm all about the command line.  I don't like to take my
					hands off the keyboard if I don't have to and for my money
					linux has the best tools for such an environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've used a number of different distros, but I don't have a
					hard preference as long as my favorite unix tools are handy
					(grep, sed, awk, etc).
				</p>
				<p>
					As stated above, I have become infatuated with <a
					target='_blank' href='http://nodejs.org'>node.js</a>.  If
					you have a project that needs to be written with node,
					please let me know as soon as possible.  Seriously, I might
					do it for free.  Ok, ok, I don't work for free.  (Really, I
					might pay you to work on it.)

				<h3>Source Control &#x00b1;&#x00b1;&#x00b1;</h3>
				<p>
					Source control is absolutely fundamental to any software
					project and using it correctly makes things go much more
					smoothly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Git is definitely what I'm most comfortable with.  It's
					fast, simple and rock-solid.  <code>stash</code>,
					<code>rebase</code>, and <code>log</code> save me huge
					amounts of time.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also have fairly extensive experience with subversion.
					DVCS is the future of source control but in the meantime
					svn is still the industry standard so I can merge tree
					conflicts without breaking a sweat.
				</p>
				<p>
					Besides git and subversion, I have a working knowledge of
					mercurial and bazaar.  Nothing fancy mind you, but given
					the need I could find my way around.
